Version: DTBC-0001
Title: Firewall traversal from remote host must be disabled.
Weight: 10.0
Severity: medium
Description:
 - VulnDiscussion: Remote connections should never be allowed that bypass the firewall, as there is no way to verify if they can be trusted. Enables usage of STUN and relay servers when remote clients are trying to establish a connection to this machine. If this setting is enabled, then remote clients can discover and connect to this machine even if they are separated by a firewall. If this setting is disabled and outgoing UDP connections are filtered by the firewall, then this machine will only allow connections from client machines within the local network. If this policy is left not set the setting will be enabled.

Title: Site tracking users location must be disabled.
Weight: 10.0
Severity: medium
Description:
 - VulnDiscussion: Website tracking is the practice of gathering information as to which websites were accesses by a browser. The common method of doing this is to have a website create a tracking cookie on the browser. If the information of what sites are being accessed is made available to unauthorized persons, this violates confidentiality requirements, and over time poses a significant OPSEC issue. This policy setting allows you to set whether websites are allowed to track the user’s physical location. Tracking the user’s physical location can be allowed by default, denied by default or the user can be asked every time a website requests the physical location. 1 = Allow sites to track the user’s physical location 2 = Do not allow any site to track the user’s physical location 3 = Ask whenever a site wants to track the user’s physical location

Title: Sites ability to show pop-ups must be disabled.
Weight: 10.0
Severity: medium
Description:
 - VulnDiscussion: Chrome allows you to manage whether unwanted pop-up windows appear. Pop-up windows that are opened when the end user clicks a link are not blocked. If you enable this policy setting, most unwanted pop-up windows are prevented from appearing. If you disable this policy setting, pop-up windows are not prevented from appearing. If you disable this policy setting, scripts can continue to create pop-up windows, and pop-ups that hide other windows. Recommend configuring this setting to ‘2’ to help prevent malicious websites from controlling the pop-up windows or fooling users into clicking on the wrong window. If you do not configure this policy setting, most unwanted pop-up windows are prevented from appearing. If this policy is left not set, 'BlockPopups' will be used and the user will be able to change it. 1 = Allow all sites to show pop-ups 2 = Do not allow any site to show pop-ups

Title: Extensions installation must be blocklisted by default.
Weight: 10.0
Severity: medium
Description:
 - VulnDiscussion: Extensions are developed by third party sources and are designed to extend Google Chrome's functionality. An extension can be made by anyone, to do and access almost anything on a system; this means they pose a high risk to any system that would allow all extensions to be installed by default. Allows you to specify which extensions the users can NOT install. Extensions already installed will be removed if blocklisted. A blocklist value of '*' means all extensions are blocklisted unless they are explicitly listed in the allowlist. If this policy is left not set the user can install any extension in Google Chrome.

Title: Extensions that are approved for use must be allowlisted.
Weight: 10.0
Severity: medium
Description:
 - VulnDiscussion: The allowlist should only contain organizationally approved extensions. This is to prevent a user from accidently allowlisitng a malicious extension. This policy allows you to specify which extensions are not subject to the blacklist. A blacklist value of ‘*’ means all extensions are blacklisted and users can only install extensions listed in the allowlist. By default, no extensions are allowlisted. If all extensions have been blacklisted by policy, then the allowlist policy can be used to allow specific extensions to be installed. Administrators should determine which extensions should be allowed to be installed by their users. If no extensions are allowlisted, then no extensions can be installed when combined with blacklisting all extensions.

Title: Background processing must be disabled.
Weight: 10.0
Severity: medium
Description:
 - VulnDiscussion: Determines whether a Google Chrome process is started on OS login that keeps running when the last browser window is closed, allowing background apps to remain active. The background process displays an icon in the system tray and can always be closed from there. If this policy is set to True, background mode is enabled and cannot be controlled by the user in the browser settings. If this policy is set to False, background mode is disabled and cannot be controlled by the user in the browser settings. If this policy is left unset, background mode is initially disabled and can be controlled by the user in the browser settings.' - Google Chrome Administrators Policy ListThis setting, if enabled, allows Google Chrome to run at all times. There is two reasons that this is not wanted. First, it can tie up system resources that might otherwise be needed. Second, it does not make it obvious to the user that it is running and poorly written extensions could cause instability on the system.

Title: The URL protocol schema javascript must be disabled.
Weight: 10.0
Severity: medium
Description:
 - VulnDiscussion: Each access to a URL is handled by the browser according to the URL's "scheme". The "scheme" of a URL is the section before the ":". The term "protocol" is often mistakenly used for a "scheme". The difference is that the scheme is how the browser handles a URL and the protocol is how the browser communicates with a service. If a scheme or its associated protocol used by a browser is insecure or obsolete, vulnerabilities can be exploited resulting in exposed data or unrestricted access to the browser's system. The browser must be configured to disable the use of insecure and obsolete schemas (protocols). This policy disables the listed protocol schemes in Google Chrome, URLs using a scheme from this list will not load and cannot be navigated to. If this policy is left not set or the list is empty all schemes will be accessible in Google Chrome.

Description:
 - VulnDiscussion: By setting this policy to true, the previous behavior is restored and online OCSP/CRL checks will be performed. If the policy is not set, or is set to false, then Chrome will not perform online revocation checks. Certificates are revoked when they have been compromised or are no longer valid, and this option protects users from submitting confidential data to a site that may be fraudulent or not secure.

Severity: medium
Description:
 - VulnDiscussion: Configure the type of downloads that Google Chrome will completely block, without letting users override the security decision. If you set this policy, Google Chrome will prevent certain types of downloads, and will not let user bypass the security warnings. When the "Block dangerous downloads" option is chosen, all downloads are allowed, except for those that carry SafeBrowsing warnings. When the "Block potentially dangerous downloads" option is chosen, all downloads allowed, except for those that carry SafeBrowsing warnings of potentially dangerous downloads. When the "Block all downloads" option is chosen, all downloads are blocked. When this policy is not set, (or the "No special restrictions" option is chosen), the downloads will go through the usual security restrictions based on SafeBrowsing analysis results. Note that these restrictions apply to downloads triggered from web page content, as well as the 'download link...' context menu option. These restrictions do not apply to the save / download of the currently displayed page, nor does it apply to saving as PDF from the printing options. See https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing for more info on SafeBrowsing. 0 = No special restrictions 1 = Block dangerous downloads 2 = Block potentially dangerous downloads 3 = Block all downloads

Title: DTBC-0006 - Extensions that are approved for use must be allowlisted
Description:
The allowlist should only contain organizationally approved extensions. This is to prevent a user from accidently allowlisitng a malicious extension. This policy allows you to specify which extensions are not subject to the blacklist.

Title: DTBC-0021 - The URL protocol schema javascript must be disabled
Description:
Each access to a URL is handled by the browser according to the URL's "scheme". The "scheme" of a URL is the section before the ":". The term "protocol" is often mistakenly used for a "scheme". The difference is that the scheme is how the browser handles a URL and the protocol is how the browser communicates with a service. If a scheme or its associated protocol used by a browser is insecure or obsolete, vulnerabilities can be exploited resulting in exposed data or unrestricted access to the browser's system. The browser must be configured to disable the use of insecure and obsolete schemas (protocols).
This policy disables the listed protocol schemes in Google Chrome, URLs using a scheme from this list will not load and cannot be navigated to. If this policy is left not set or the list is empty all schemes will be accessible in Google Chrome.
Criteria:
 - Test Ref.: oval:mil.disa.stig.chrome:tst:2400211

Title: DTBC-0055 - Download restrictions must be configured.
Description:
Configure the type of downloads that Google Chrome will completely block, without letting users override the security decision. If you set this policy, Google Chrome will prevent certain types of downloads, and will not let user bypass the security warnings. When the "Block dangerous downloads" option is chosen, all downloads are allowed, except for those that carry SafeBrowsing warnings. When the "Block potentially dangerous downloads" option is chosen, all downloads allowed, except for those that carry SafeBrowsing warnings of potentially dangerous downloads. When the "Block all downloads" option is chosen, all downloads are blocked.  When this policy is not set, (or the "No special restrictions" option is chosen), the downloads will go through the usual security restrictions based on SafeBrowsing analysis results.

Note that these restrictions apply to downloads triggered from web page content, as well as the 'download link...' context menu option. These restrictions do not apply to the save / download of the currently displayed page, nor does it apply to saving as PDF from the printing options. See https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing for more info on SafeBrowsing.
0 = No special restrictions
1 = Block dangerous downloads
2 = Block potentially dangerous downloads
3 = Block all downloads
